## The Deseret Keyboard

Developed in Utah by Mormon pioneers, the Deseret alphabet was designed to
phonetically represent the English language. And since it was accepted into
Unicode in 2001, practically every computer on the planet now supports it! So
don't procrastinate the day of your repentance, start writing holier text today!

This software is for Linux only. To use the Deseret layout, run
`xkbcomp -I. deseret.xkb $DISPLAY` and to switch back to an impious layout, run
`setxkbmap -model pc104`

Hold down the Super key (the Windows key if you are on a PC or the Command key
if you are on a Mac) to type short vowels and alternative consonants.

Dipthongs are created by pressing the X key and then a vowel:
* X + I = 𐐌 (Ay)
* X + U = 𐐍 (Ow)
* X + O = 𐐦 (Oi)
* X + Y = 𐐧 (Ew)
